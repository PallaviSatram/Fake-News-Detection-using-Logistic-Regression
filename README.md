# Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles as *real* or *fake* using Logistic Regression. The system processes text data with techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to extract meaningful features before training the model.  
The goal of this project is to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning concepts applied to misinformation detection.

🚀 **Status:** Model training completed 

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using a **Logistic Regression** model.  
The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess textual data and classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their content.

The main objective is to build a reliable ML model that can identify misinformation efficiently — serving as a foundational step toward developing a full-fledged fake news detection application.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Collection:**  
   Used a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles.  
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Removed null values and duplicates  
   - Cleaned text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)  
   - Tokenization  
   - TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction  

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
   - Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy Score
